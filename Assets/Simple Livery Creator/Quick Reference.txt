To add a custom sticker to your vehicle, drag and drop it in Assets/Simple Livery Creator/Sprites/Decal Library. Change the imported texture type to Sprite (2D and UI) and depending on the size of the image, pixels per unit from 1000 (For Smaller Res stickers) -2000 (For Larger Res stickers). Click on Update Decal Libray > Update on the top menu bar and you will have the sticker in your Decals top bar.

To save the livery, click on Save (UI Button on the Left panel). The livery will be available to you in the MyLiveries folder.

To make a build, please comment out the following lines in the LiveryCreator.cs : 315, 323 to 329

To make the asset look realistic we used post processing stack v1's SSR (screen space reflections) which are relatively free from artefacts. You could alternatively use a terrain collider to paint of water on the asphalt as well as paint road markings on it to take the realism of the asset to the next level.

Please contact us on our support website for questions or suggestions. We typically reply to requests with support in a few hours. We are working to include a whole library of sprites as artwork so keep this package updated for the latest and greatest.

If you enjoyed the asset please leave a rating. We are always overjoyed to see our customers like our products and it motivates us to improve the package and keep on adding newer sprites.
