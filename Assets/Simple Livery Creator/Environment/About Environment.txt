Basic Livery Environment:

Highly modular model assets which can be replaced and rearranged with ease.
You add or delete an environment by going into your scene > Canvas > Change Background. You will find an editable array of environments.
You can remove this environment by hitting on the subtract button on element 1.
By doing so you will have only the first environment.
The asphalt has a smoothness texture applied to it and albedo and normal are on the secondary map so they do not interfere with the scaling of the smoothness map.
To get the most out of the asphalt, you can use a terrain object and paint smoothness to create water affect. Use SSR in the post processing to get watery reflections.
Please Note:
The post processing stack's SSR flickers and artefacts. Use post processing stack v1's SSR if possible. 
Even though the environment is lightweight in terms of textures and models, you could stand to gain a few more frames per second on the first Background scene and cut out 80mb on the project file.
